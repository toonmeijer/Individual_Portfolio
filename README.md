## Individual Portfolio - Toon Meijer

Hi, I am Toon, a first-year Geo-Information Science student! I have followed a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Artificial Intelligence before this year. I chose to follow this course based on the course program: working on one big project in a group of people from various backgrounds. My general goal in this course is to combine and put into practice various programming techniques that I have learned during other courses over the past year. Normally, in other courses, there is no time to sufficiently practice one subject before moving on to the next.
### Learning goals

- Performing model evaluations: I would like to work with different models suitable for our project goal and compare them based on characteristics such as prediction accuracy and complexity. A Jupyter Notebook will be added to my portfolio where the models are evaluated.

- Creating an interactive visualization: For our project goal, a wind visualization that the user can tweak to his/her liking would be beneficial to our end goal. I know how to make a simple matplotlib visualization but I want to learn how to make more complex plots. This visualization will also be included in my portfolio in an interactive way, such as with Jupyter Notebook. What will be represented depends on how well the project goes, ideally a wind map of Amsterdam where the user can set height, wind speed and wind direction.

- Improve my GitHub skills: I know how to pull and push, but not much more than that. I would like to learn how to solve merge conflicts, create project forks and revert to previous moments in time on a branch.

- Writing a reflection on the ethics and privacy aspect of our datasets and results. There will be a reflection of at least one page included in my portfolio.
